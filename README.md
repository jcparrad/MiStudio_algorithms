# Algorithm Design and Implementation

This repository contains the design and implementation of various algorithms and data structures, focusing on several patterns. Each pattern is accompanied by detailed explanations and examples in Jupyter notebooks.

## Patterns

### Heaps

1. **Initial Public Offering (IPO)**: The algorithm for solving the IPO problem using heaps can be found in the following Jupyter notebook:
